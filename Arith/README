===============
Program Architecture

40image.c 
    Reads the command line arguments and either calls the compress or decompress
    functions

compress40.c / compress40.h
    Runs the compression and decompression processes. Reads either uncompressed
    or compressed images and outputs compressed and decompressed images. 
    
convert40.c / convert40.h
    Functions for converting between the different pixel representations (i.e 
    component-video, discrete cosine transformation, quantized dct) used during
    compression and decompression 

bitpack.c / bitpack.h 
    Functions for packing and retrieving values to and from words 

pack40.c / pack40.h 
    Functions for unpacking values from the words into the quantized dct space
    
math40.c / math40.h
    Functions for performing math operations (i.e rounding) on floats
